### Algorithm: Building a Reverse Proxy Server in C

A **reverse proxy server** acts as an intermediary for servers, routing incoming client requests to backend servers and returning responses to clients as if they originated from the proxy itself. Reverse proxies are commonly used for load balancing, caching, SSL termination, and hiding the backend server architecture.

---

### **Key Functional Requirements**
1. **Intercept and forward client requests**: Handle client requests and forward them to appropriate backend servers.
2. **Serve backend responses**: Relay responses from backend servers to clients transparently.
3. **Load Balancing (Optional)**: Distribute client requests across multiple backend servers.
4. **Caching (Optional)**: Cache frequently requested resources to improve performance.
5. **HTTPS Termination (Optional)**: Handle SSL/TLS encryption and forward plain HTTP traffic to backend servers.

---

### **Algorithm**

---

### **Step 1: Import Required Libraries**
- Include libraries for:
  - **Socket programming**: For network communication with clients and backend servers.
  - **String manipulation**: For parsing HTTP headers and managing requests.
  - **File I/O**: For optional caching or logging.
  - **Multithreading**: To handle multiple client requests simultaneously.

---

### **Step 2: Define Reverse Proxy Configuration**
1. **Port**: Define a port number for the proxy to listen on (e.g., `8080`).
2. **Backend Servers**: Maintain a list of backend servers (IP/hostname and port).
3. **Load Balancing (Optional)**:
   - Define a method (e.g., round-robin or least-connections) to distribute requests across backend servers.
4. **Buffer Sizes**: Set buffer sizes for reading requests and responses (e.g., `4096` bytes).
5. **Timeouts**: Define timeouts for client-backend communication.
6. **Caching Directory (Optional)**: Specify a directory to store cached responses.

---

### **Step 3: Create and Configure the Reverse Proxy Server Socket**
1. **Create a TCP socket**:
   - Use the `socket()` function to create the server socket.
2. **Bind the socket**:
   - Bind the socket to the configured port and IP address (`INADDR_ANY` for all available interfaces).
3. **Set to listen mode**:
   - Use `listen()` to accept incoming client connections.
4. **Error Handling**:
   - Print error messages and terminate the program if socket creation, binding, or listening fails.

---

### **Step 4: Accept Incoming Client Connections**
1. Enter a loop to accept client connections:
   - Use the `accept()` function to handle incoming client connections.
2. For each client:
   - Spawn a new thread (or process) to handle the client request.

---

### **Step 5: Parse and Forward Client Requests**

#### **5.1: Read and Parse the Client Request**
1. **Read the request**:
   - Use `recv()` to read the HTTP request from the client into a buffer.
2. **Extract request components**:
   - Parse the HTTP request line (e.g., `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`).
   - Extract the resource URI, HTTP method, headers, and body if applicable.

#### **5.2: Determine Target Backend Server**
1. **Select a backend server**:
   - Use a load-balancing algorithm (e.g., round-robin, random selection, or least-connections) to choose a backend server from the configured list.
   - Extract the server’s IP address and port.
2. **Rewrite the Host header**:
   - Replace the `Host` header in the HTTP request with the target backend server’s address if necessary.

---

### **Step 6: Connect to the Backend Server**
1. **Create a new socket**:
   - Use `socket()` to create a connection to the backend server.
2. **Resolve the backend server’s IP**:
   - Use `getaddrinfo()` or `gethostbyname()` to resolve the backend server’s hostname.
3. **Establish a connection**:
   - Use `connect()` to connect to the backend server on the specified port.
4. **Error Handling**:
   - If the connection fails, send a `502 Bad Gateway` response to the client.

---

### **Step 7: Relay Data Between Client and Backend Server**

#### **7.1: Forward the Client Request**
1. **Send the request**:
   - Use `send()` to forward the client’s HTTP request to the selected backend server.

#### **7.2: Receive and Relay the Backend Response**
1. **Read the response**:
   - Use `recv()` to read the backend server’s response in chunks.
2. **Relay the response**:
   - Send the received data back to the client using `send()`.

---

### **Step 8: Implement Caching (Optional)**
1. **Check for cached resources**:
   - Before forwarding the request, check if the requested resource is cached locally.
   - If cached, serve the resource directly to the client without contacting the backend server.
2. **Cache the response**:
   - Save backend server responses to the cache directory, using a hash of the URL as the filename.

---

### **Step 9: Implement Load Balancing (Optional)**
1. **Round-Robin**:
   - Maintain a counter to track which backend server was used last.
   - Forward the next request to the next server in the list.
2. **Least-Connections**:
   - Track the number of active connections per backend server.
   - Forward requests to the server with the fewest active connections.

---

### **Step 10: Implement HTTPS Termination (Optional)**
1. Use libraries like OpenSSL to:
   - Accept HTTPS connections from clients.
   - Decrypt HTTPS traffic.
   - Forward plain HTTP traffic to the backend servers.
2. Re-encrypt traffic for secure connections to backend servers if needed.

---

### **Step 11: Close Connections**
- After relaying the response, close both the client and backend server sockets unless using persistent connections.

---

### **Step 12: Handle Concurrency**
1. **Threaded Approach**:
   - Create a new thread for each client connection.
2. **Thread Pool (Optional)**:
   - Use a thread pool to limit the number of simultaneous threads.

**Pseudo Code for Threaded Implementation**:
```
Thread_Pool pool;
initialize_thread_pool(pool, MAX_THREADS);

while (true):
    client_socket = accept(server_socket);
    assign thread from pool to handle_client(client_socket);
```

---

### **Step 13: Graceful Shutdown**
1. Close all open sockets.
2. Terminate threads or processes cleanly.
3. Free any dynamically allocated resources.

---

### **Pseudo Code**

```
START
    CONFIGURE reverse proxy (port, backend servers, load balancing, caching)
    CREATE server socket
    BIND server socket to specified port
    LISTEN for incoming connections
    
    WHILE true:
        client_socket = ACCEPT incoming connection
        SPAWN thread to handle_client(client_socket)
    
    FUNCTION handle_client(client_socket):
        REQUEST = READ from client_socket
        PARSE resource URI, headers, and HTTP method
        
        SELECT backend server using load balancing
        CONNECT to backend server
        
        IF connection fails:
            SEND 502 Bad Gateway response to client
            CLOSE client_socket
            RETURN
        
        FORWARD request to backend server
        RECEIVE response from backend server
        RELAY response to client
        
        CLOSE client_socket and backend server socket
    END FUNCTION
END
```

### **Enhancements**
1. **Health Checks**:
   - Periodically check the health of backend servers and exclude unhealthy servers from the load balancer.
2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement rules to allow or deny access based on client IP or request headers.
3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Limit the number of requests a client can make in a given time frame.
4. **Monitoring**:
   - Log traffic and statistics for real-time monitoring and debugging.
5. **SSL/TLS Support**:
   - Add HTTPS termination for secure client-proxy communication.
