### Algorithm: Building a Forward Proxy Server in C

A **forward proxy server** acts as an intermediary between a client and the internet, routing client requests through itself to mask the clientâ€™s identity, enforce access policies, or cache content. Below is a step-by-step algorithm for designing and implementing a forward proxy server in C.

---

### **Key Functional Requirements**
1. **Intercept and forward client requests**: The proxy receives client requests, forwards them to the target server, and relays the response back to the client.
2. **Handle HTTP requests**: Implement basic support for HTTP (and optionally HTTPS).
3. **Routing**: Forward client requests while maintaining the connection between client and server.
4. **Policy Enforcement (Optional)**: Enforce rules like blocking certain domains or IPs.
5. **Caching (Optional)**: Cache frequently requested resources to improve performance.

---

### **Algorithm**

---

### **Step 1: Import Required Libraries**
- Include libraries for:
  - **Socket programming** for network communication.
  - **String manipulation** for parsing HTTP headers.
  - **File I/O** for optional caching or logging.
  - **Multithreading** to handle multiple client requests simultaneously.

---

### **Step 2: Define Proxy Configuration**
1. **Port**: Define a port number for the proxy to listen on (e.g., `8888`).
2. **Buffer Sizes**: Set buffer sizes for reading client requests and server responses (e.g., `4096` bytes).
3. **Connection Timeout**: Define timeouts for client-server communication.
4. **Blocked Domains (Optional)**: Maintain a list of domains/IPs to block.
5. **Cache Directory (Optional)**: Define a directory to store cached responses.

---

### **Step 3: Create and Configure the Proxy Server Socket**
1. **Create a TCP socket**:
   - Use the `socket()` function to create a server socket.
2. **Bind the socket**:
   - Bind the socket to the configured port and IP address (`INADDR_ANY` for all available interfaces).
3. **Set to listen mode**:
   - Use `listen()` to accept incoming client connections.
4. **Error Handling**:
   - Print error messages and terminate the program if socket creation, binding, or listening fails.

---

### **Step 4: Accept Incoming Client Connections**
1. Enter a loop to accept client connections:
   - Use the `accept()` function to handle a new client.
2. For each client:
   - Spawn a new thread (or process) to handle the client request.

---

### **Step 5: Parse and Forward Client Requests**

#### **5.1: Read and Parse the Client Request**
1. **Read the request**:
   - Use `recv()` to read the HTTP request from the client into a buffer.
2. **Extract the target server and resource**:
   - Parse the HTTP request headers (specifically the `Host` and `GET`/`POST` line).
   - Extract the hostname, port (default to 80 for HTTP), and resource URI.

**Example Request Parsing:**
```
Client sends: GET http://example.com/index.html HTTP/1.1
Parse:
  - Host: example.com
  - Resource: /index.html
  - Port: 80 (default for HTTP)
```

#### **5.2: Handle Blocked Domains (Optional)**
1. Check if the target domain/IP is in the blocked list.
   - If blocked, send a `403 Forbidden` response to the client and close the connection.

---

### **Step 6: Connect to the Target Server**
1. **Create a new socket**:
   - Use `socket()` to create a new connection to the target server.
2. **Resolve the hostname**:
   - Use `getaddrinfo()` or `gethostbyname()` to resolve the target server's IP address.
3. **Establish a connection**:
   - Use `connect()` to connect to the target server on the specified port.
4. **Error Handling**:
   - If the connection fails, send a `502 Bad Gateway` response to the client.

---

### **Step 7: Relay Data Between Client and Server**

#### **7.1: Forward the Client Request**
1. **Send the request**:
   - Use `send()` to forward the parsed HTTP request to the target server.

#### **7.2: Receive and Relay the Server Response**
1. **Read the server response**:
   - Use `recv()` to read the response from the server in chunks.
2. **Relay the response**:
   - Send the received data to the client using `send()`.

---

### **Step 8: Handle Persistent Connections (Optional)**
- If the HTTP version is `1.1` and the `Connection` header is set to `keep-alive`, keep the socket open to handle additional requests on the same connection.

---

### **Step 9: Implement Logging and Caching (Optional)**

#### **9.1: Logging**
1. Log each request and response in a structured format:
   - Timestamp
   - Client IP
   - Requested URL
   - Response status code

#### **9.2: Caching**
1. Check if the requested resource is already cached.
   - If cached, serve the response from the cache instead of forwarding the request.
2. Cache the response:
   - Save the server response to a file in the cache directory, using a hash of the URL as the filename.

---

### **Step 10: Close Connections**
- After relaying the response, close both the client and server sockets unless using persistent connections.

---

### **Step 11: Handle Concurrency**
1. **Threaded Approach**:
   - Create a new thread for each client connection to handle the request and response.
2. **Thread Pool (Optional)**:
   - Use a thread pool to limit the number of simultaneous threads.

**Pseudo Code for Threaded Implementation**:
```
Thread_Pool pool;
initialize_thread_pool(pool, MAX_THREADS);

while (true):
    client_socket = accept(server_socket);
    assign thread from pool to handle_client(client_socket);
```

---

### **Step 12: Graceful Shutdown**
1. Close all open sockets.
2. Terminate threads or processes cleanly.
3. Free any dynamically allocated resources.

## **Pseudo Code**

```
START
    CONFIGURE proxy server (port, buffer size, cache, blocked domains)
    CREATE server socket
    BIND server socket to specified port
    LISTEN for incoming connections
    
    WHILE true:
        client_socket = ACCEPT incoming connection
        SPAWN thread to handle_client(client_socket)
    
    FUNCTION handle_client(client_socket):
        REQUEST = READ from client_socket
        PARSE target host, port, and resource from REQUEST
        
        IF host is in blocked list:
            SEND 403 Forbidden response to client
            CLOSE client_socket
            RETURN
        
        CREATE socket to connect to target host
        CONNECT to target server
        FORWARD client request to target server
        RECEIVE response from target server
        RELAY response to client
        
        CLOSE client_socket and target server socket
    END FUNCTION
END
```

### **Enhancements**
1. **SSL/TLS Support**:
   - Implement HTTPS support using libraries like OpenSSL to encrypt client-server communications.
2. **Access Control**:
   - Add authentication mechanisms to restrict proxy usage.
3. **Load Balancing**:
   - Distribute requests across multiple target servers for load balancing.
4. **Monitoring**:
   - Implement real-time monitoring for traffic analysis and debugging.
5. **Bandwidth Throttling**:
   - Limit the data transfer rate for certain clients or domains.
