## Algorithm: TCP File Transfer Program in C
A TCP file transfer program allows one device (client) to send a file to another device (server) over a network using the TCP protocol, ensuring reliable data transfer. Below is a detailed algorithm for building a TCP file transfer program in C that consists of a server (which receives the file) and a client (which sends the file).

## Part 1: Server-Side Algorithm

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries
Use libraries like <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h>, <sys/socket.h>, <arpa/inet.h>, and <unistd.h> to manage sockets, handle file I/O, and perform basic networking.

### Step 2: Define Server Connection Parameters
IP Address: Define the IP address on which the server will listen (e.g., INADDR_ANY for any local IP).
Port: Define a port for the server to listen for incoming connections (e.g., 12345). Ensure this port is available and not used by other services.

### Step 3: Create and Bind the Server Socket
Create a socket: Use the socket() function to create a TCP socket (SOCK_STREAM).
Bind the socket: Bind it to the specified IP and port, so it listens on that network interface.

### Step 4: Listen for Incoming Connections
Set the socket to listen mode using listen(), allowing it to accept incoming client connections.
Define a maximum backlog (number of clients that can wait to connect at once).

### Step 5: Accept a Client Connection
Accept the connection: When a client attempts to connect, use accept() to establish a new socket dedicated to this client connection.

### Step 6: Open File for Writing
Receive the file name: Start by receiving the file name or metadata from the client. Store this in a buffer.
Open the file: Create or open a file with the specified name in write mode (wb for binary files) to prepare for data storage.

### Step 7: Receive Data from Client and Write to File
Receive data in chunks: In a loop, receive data from the client using recv() with a fixed buffer size.
Write data to file: After each chunk is received, write it directly to the file to avoid memory overflow.
Continue until the entire file is transferred (indicated by an empty or end-of-file message from the client).

### Step 8: Close the File and Client Socket
Close the file once the transfer is complete.
Close the client socket to release resources after the file is fully received.

### Step 9: Clean Up and Exit
After finishing with the client, close the main server socket.
Optionally, allow the server to restart and wait for a new client or exit the program.

## Part 2: Client-Side Algorithm

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries
Use libraries like <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h>, <sys/socket.h>, <arpa/inet.h>, and <unistd.h> to manage sockets and handle file I/O.

### Step 2: Define Server Connection Parameters
Server IP Address: Specify the IP address of the server to which the client will connect.
Server Port: Ensure it matches the server’s port.

### Step 3: Create and Connect the Client Socket
Create a socket: Use socket() to create a TCP socket (SOCK_STREAM).
Connect to the server: Use connect() to establish a connection with the server using the specified IP and port.

### Step 4: Prompt User for File to Send
Get the file path: Prompt the user to enter the name or path of the file they want to send.
Open the file in read mode (rb for binary files) to prepare for data transfer.

### Step 5: Send the File Name to the Server
Extract the file name from the full path (if necessary) to provide only the file’s base name.
Send file name: Use send() to send the file name or metadata to the server.

### Step 6: Read Data from File and Send to Server
Read file in chunks: In a loop, read fixed-size chunks of data from the file.
Send each chunk: After reading a chunk, use send() to send it to the server.
Continue until the entire file is read and sent to the server.

### Step 7: Close File and Socket
Close the file once all data has been sent.
Close the client socket after the transfer is complete to release resources.

### Step 8: Display Transfer Completion Message
Notify the user that the file transfer was successful.

## Part 3: Detailed Steps Recap
Server-Side:

Import libraries.
Define IP and port for the server.
Create and bind a server socket.
Listen for connections and accept a client connection.
Receive the file name and create a file for writing.
Receive data in chunks, writing it to the file.
Close the file and client connection, then clean up the server socket.
Client-Side:

Import libraries.
Define server IP and port.
Create and connect a client socket.
Prompt user for the file to transfer and open it.
Send the file name to the server.
Send the file data in chunks.
Close the file and socket, then notify the user of successful transfer.
Additional Considerations
Error Handling:

Socket errors: Check for errors when creating, binding, connecting, sending, and receiving on sockets.
File errors: Handle cases where the file does not exist, cannot be opened, or has restricted access.
Network interruptions: Implement mechanisms to handle timeouts or reconnections if the network fails.
Buffer Size: Define a buffer size (e.g., 1024 bytes) for reading from and writing to files. Ensure that both client and server use the same buffer size for compatibility.

End-of-File Detection: Use flags or signals to indicate the end of the file transfer, such as:

Sending a specific end-of-file (EOF) message.
Sending the file size in advance so the server knows when to stop receiving data.
Timeouts and Retries: Add timeouts for socket operations to avoid indefinite blocking. Implement retries in case of network delays.

Concurrency: To handle multiple clients on the server side, consider using threads. Each thread would handle one client connection independently, allowing for simultaneous transfers.

File Integrity: Add a checksum mechanism (e.g., MD5 or SHA-256) to verify file integrity after transfer. The client can calculate a checksum and send it to the server, which verifies it after the entire file is received.

Security: Consider adding encryption for secure file transfer, especially for sensitive data. Using SSL/TLS is one option, or you could implement custom encryption.

Progress Indicators: For larger files, provide feedback to the user by calculating and displaying the percentage of file transfer completed.
