Since you're already comfortable with socket programming and want to advance your networking skills in C, you should focus on projects that challenge you in areas like concurrency, security, performance, and real-world networking concepts. Here are some projects that will significantly improve your skills:  

### **1. Multi-Client Chat Server** *(Intermediate → Advanced)*  
- Upgrade your current chat program to support multiple clients concurrently using **multi-threading** or **multiplexing (select/epoll)**.  
- Implement **private messaging** between clients.  
- Add **encryption (TLS/SSL)** for secure communication using OpenSSL.  

### **2. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Server & Client** *(Intermediate → Advanced)*  
- Implement a **simple FTP server** that allows clients to upload and download files.  
- Support **multiple clients concurrently**.  
- Implement **resume functionality** (for interrupted downloads).  
- Add **authentication** (username/password system).  

### **3. HTTP Web Server (Mini Apache/Nginx Clone)** *(Advanced)*  
- Build a **basic HTTP web server** that can handle multiple client requests.  
- Implement **GET and POST methods**.  
- Serve **static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.)**.  
- Optionally, implement **CGI scripting support**.  
- Bonus: Implement **HTTPS support** using OpenSSL.  

### **4. Proxy Server (Forward & Reverse Proxy)** *(Advanced)*  
- Develop a **forward proxy** that routes client requests through itself (like VPNs).  
- Implement **content filtering** (e.g., block access to certain websites).  
- Create a **reverse proxy** that load balances between multiple backend servers.  
- Bonus: Implement **caching** for frequently requested data.  

### **5. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) File Sharing System** *(Advanced)*  
- Allow clients to discover peers and exchange files directly.  
- Implement a **tracker server** to help peers find each other.  
- Optimize using **UDP for fast transfers**.  
- Implement **encryption and integrity verification**.  

### **6. DNS Resolver (Custom DNS Client & Server)** *(Advanced)*  
- Build a **custom DNS resolver** that queries public DNS servers.  
- Implement a **DNS caching mechanism** to reduce lookup times.  
- Create a **DNS server** that resolves domain names for a local network.  

### **7. Network Scanner (Basic Nmap Alternative)** *(Intermediate → Advanced)*  
- Create a tool to **scan open ports** on a given IP or subnet.  
- Implement **ICMP ping scans**.  
- Support **TCP SYN/ACK scanning** (requires **raw sockets**).  
- Bonus: Implement **OS fingerprinting** (detect OS of target machine).  

### **8. TCP/IP Stack Implementation (Mini TCP/IP Stack)** *(Expert Level)*  
- Implement a **basic TCP/IP stack** using **raw sockets**.  
- Handle **ARP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP packets** manually.  
- Create a **custom packet sniffer** to inspect network traffic.  

### **Which One Should You Start With?**  
Since you've already built a chat server, I'd recommend improving it by adding **multi-client support, encryption, and authentication**. Then, move on to building an **FTP server or an HTTP web server**, as these are widely used in real-world applications.  

Would you like guidance on structuring any of these projects?
