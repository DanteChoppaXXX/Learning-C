### Algorithm: Building a HTTP Web Server in C to Handle Multiple Client Requests

A robust HTTP server in C must handle multiple client requests simultaneously, support basic HTTP methods like **GET** and **POST**, and serve static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. Below is a step-by-step algorithm to build such a web server.

---

## **Key Functional Requirements**
1. Handle multiple clients concurrently.
2. Support basic HTTP methods: **GET** and **POST**.
3. Serve static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.).
4. Manage error handling for bad requests and unavailable resources.
5. Keep the implementation scalable and efficient.

## **Algorithm**

### **Step 1: Import Required Libraries**
- Include libraries for:
  - **Socket programming** for networking.
  - **File I/O** for serving static files.
  - **Multithreading** for handling concurrent requests.
  - **String manipulation** for parsing HTTP requests.

---

### **Step 2: Define Server Configuration**
1. **Port**: Choose a port number (e.g., `8080`) for the server to listen on.
2. **Document Root**: Define the directory where static files are stored (e.g., `www`).
3. **Buffer Sizes**: Set buffer sizes for reading HTTP headers, request bodies, and file contents (e.g., `1024` bytes).
4. **Thread Pool (Optional)**: Configure thread pool size for concurrent request handling.

---

### **Step 3: Create and Configure the Server Socket**
1. **Create a socket**:
   - Use the `socket()` function to create a TCP socket.
2. **Bind the socket**:
   - Bind it to the specified port and IP address (`INADDR_ANY` for all available interfaces).
3. **Set to listen mode**:
   - Use `listen()` to set the socket to accept incoming client connections.
4. **Handle errors**:
   - If socket creation, binding, or listening fails, print an error message and exit.

---

### **Step 4: Accept Incoming Client Connections**
1. Enter a loop to accept client connections:
   - Use the `accept()` function to accept a new connection.
2. For each connection:
   - Create a new thread (or fork a process) to handle the client request.

---

### **Step 5: Parse the HTTP Request**
1. **Read the request**:
   - Use `recv()` to read the client's HTTP request into a buffer.
2. **Extract HTTP method**:
   - Parse the first line of the request to identify the HTTP method (e.g., `GET`, `POST`).
3. **Extract the requested resource**:
   - Parse the URI to determine which file or endpoint is being requested.
   - For example:
     - A request for `/index.html` maps to `www/index.html`.
     - A request for `/` maps to the default file (e.g., `www/index.html`).

---

### **Step 6: Handle HTTP Methods**

#### **6.1: Handle GET Requests**
1. **Locate the requested file**:
   - Append the requested URI to the document root.
   - If the URI is `/`, serve the default file (e.g., `index.html`).
2. **Check if the file exists**:
   - Use `stat()` or `fopen()` to verify the file's existence.
   - If the file does not exist, return a **404 Not Found** response.
3. **Serve the file**:
   - Open the file in read mode.
   - Read the file contents into a buffer and send it to the client using `send()`.

#### **6.2: Handle POST Requests**
1. **Read the request body**:
   - Parse the HTTP headers to determine the `Content-Length`.
   - Use `recv()` to read the request body into a buffer.
2. **Process the request data**:
   - Parse form data or JSON payload based on the `Content-Type` header.
3. **Generate a response**:
   - Construct a dynamic response (e.g., echo back the submitted data).
   - Send the response back to the client.

---

### **Step 7: Generate HTTP Responses**

#### **7.1: Build Response Headers**
1. **Status Line**:
   - Use `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` for successful responses.
   - Use `HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found` or `HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error` for errors.
2. **Headers**:
   - Add standard headers, such as:
     - `Content-Type`: Specify the MIME type (e.g., `text/html`, `image/jpeg`).
     - `Content-Length`: Specify the size of the response body.
     - `Connection`: Use `close` or `keep-alive`.

#### **7.2: Send the Response**
- Send the headers and body to the client using `send()`.

---

### **Step 8: Serve Static Files**
1. **Determine File Type**:
   - Based on the file extension, set the `Content-Type` header (e.g., `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, `.jpg`).
2. **Read File in Chunks**:
   - For large files, read and send the file in chunks to optimize memory usage.
3. **Send File Data**:
   - Send each chunk using `send()` until the entire file is transmitted.

---

### **Step 9: Close the Client Connection**
- After sending the response, close the client socket using `close()`.

---

### **Step 10: Implement Concurrency**
1. **Threaded Approach**:
   - Create a thread for each client connection.
   - Each thread executes the function to process the client's request.
2. **Thread Pool (Optional)**:
   - Use a fixed thread pool for better performance and resource management.

**Pseudo Code for Multithreading**:
```
Thread_Pool pool;
initialize_thread_pool(pool, MAX_THREADS);

while (true):
    client_socket = accept(server_socket);
    assign thread from pool to handle_client(client_socket);
```

---

### **Step 11: Error Handling**
1. Handle common errors:
   - **Invalid HTTP requests**: Return a **400 Bad Request** response.
   - **Missing files**: Return a **404 Not Found** response.
   - **Internal server errors**: Return a **500 Internal Server Error** response.
2. Log errors for debugging:
   - Write errors and access logs to a file.

---

### **Step 12: Graceful Shutdown**
1. Close all open sockets.
2. Terminate threads or processes cleanly.
3. Free any dynamically allocated memory.

## **Pseudo Code**

```
START
    CONFIGURE server (port, document root, buffer sizes)
    CREATE server socket
    BIND server socket to port
    LISTEN for incoming connections
    
    WHILE true:
        client_socket = ACCEPT incoming connection
        CREATE thread to handle_client(client_socket)
    
    FUNCTION handle_client(client_socket):
        REQUEST = READ from client_socket
        PARSE HTTP method and resource from REQUEST
        
        IF method is GET:
            RESOURCE_PATH = map URI to file in document root
            IF file exists:
                SEND 200 OK response and file contents
            ELSE:
                SEND 404 Not Found response
        ELSE IF method is POST:
            BODY = parse request body
            PROCESS request data
            SEND dynamic response with 200 OK
        ELSE:
            SEND 405 Method Not Allowed response
        
        CLOSE client_socket
    END FUNCTION
END
```

## **Enhancements**
1. **Security**:
   - Validate user input to prevent directory traversal attacks.
   - Restrict access to certain file types or directories.
2. **Logging**:
   - Record request details (method, URI, status code) in a log file.
3. **Compression**:
   - Add support for gzip compression to improve performance.
4. **Scalability**:
   - Use non-blocking sockets or event-driven frameworks for better scalability.
