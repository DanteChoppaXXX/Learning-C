Algorithm: Password Strength Checker

A password strength checker evaluates a password based on various criteria such as length, character variety, and complexity to determine how secure it is. Here's a step-by-step algorithm for writing a password strength checker program:

Step 1: Define Strength Criteria
Set specific criteria that will determine whether a password is considered strong. Typically, these include:

Length: The longer the password, the stronger it is. A minimum of 8-12 characters is common for basic security.
Uppercase Letters: Strong passwords should contain at least one uppercase letter.
Lowercase Letters: At least one lowercase letter should be present.
Digits: Passwords should include at least one numeric digit (0-9).
Special Characters: Special symbols (e.g., !, @, #, $, etc.) add complexity and improve strength.
No Repeated Characters: Check for sequences of repeated characters (e.g., aaaa).
No Dictionary Words: The password should not contain common words, dictionary words, or obvious patterns (e.g., password123).

Step 2: Gather Input
Prompt the user to enter a password that they want to check.

Step 3: Initialize Score and Flags
Initialize a strength score to 0. This score will increase based on the satisfaction of the criteria.
Create flags for each criteria (length, uppercase, lowercase, digit, special characters) to check if they are met.

Step 4: Check Password Length
Check the length of the password.
If the length is below the minimum requirement (e.g., less than 8 characters), return a warning and stop further checks.
If the length is adequate (e.g., 8-12 characters), increase the strength score by a defined amount.
Assign a larger bonus if the length exceeds a strong threshold (e.g., over 12 characters).

Step 5: Check for Uppercase Letters
Traverse the password to check if there is at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
If found, increase the strength score and mark the uppercase flag as true.

Step 6: Check for Lowercase Letters
Traverse the password to check if there is at least one lowercase letter (a-z).
If found, increase the strength score and mark the lowercase flag as true.

Step 7: Check for Digits
Traverse the password to check if there is at least one digit (0-9).
If found, increase the strength score and mark the digit flag as true.

Step 8: Check for Special Characters
Traverse the password to check for any special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, etc.).
If found, increase the strength score and mark the special character flag as true.

Step 9: Check for Repeated Characters
Traverse the password to identify repeated characters or character sequences (e.g., aaaa, 1234).
If repeated sequences are found, decrease the score as repeated characters reduce the password’s randomness.

Step 10: Check for Common Patterns or Dictionary Words
Compare the password against a set of common passwords (e.g., password, 123456, qwerty) or dictionary words.
If the password contains dictionary words or common patterns, significantly decrease the score.
Use techniques like searching for substrings or pattern matching to detect obvious words or patterns.

Step 11: Evaluate the Password’s Complexity
Consider combinations of character types:
If the password contains both uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, give a high complexity score.
If only a few types of characters are used, decrease the complexity score.

Step 12: Assign Password Strength Level
Based on the final score:
Weak: If the score is below a threshold (e.g., less than 5 points), classify the password as "Weak."
Moderate: If the score is within a certain range (e.g., 5-8 points), classify it as "Moderate."
Strong: If the score exceeds a certain high threshold (e.g., 9-12 points), classify it as "Strong."

Step 13: Provide Feedback
After classifying the password's strength, provide feedback to the user:
If the password is Weak, suggest ways to improve it (e.g., "Add more characters", "Include special characters").
If the password is Moderate, suggest specific actions to strengthen it further (e.g., "Include uppercase letters or digits").
If the password is Strong, provide positive feedback (e.g., "Your password is strong!").

Step 14: Loop for Multiple Passwords (Optional)
Optionally, allow the user to check another password by repeating steps 2 through 13 until they decide to stop.

Step 15: Exit the Program
Terminate the program after the user has checked all desired passwords.
