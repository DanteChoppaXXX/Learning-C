## Algorithm: File Encryptor / Decryptor

## Step 1: Define Encryption/Decryption Method

Choose an encryption algorithm (e.g., symmetric encryption like AES or simple schemes like XOR-based encryption for learning purposes).
Symmetric Encryption: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption.
Asymmetric Encryption: Uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption (more complex).
For simplicity, we assume symmetric encryption (same key for encryption and decryption) in this algorithm.

## Step 2: Gather Input from the User

Prompt the user to choose between encryption and decryption.
Ask for the file path of the file to be encrypted or decrypted.
Prompt for the encryption key (can be a password or any secret key), which will be used to encrypt/decrypt the file. Ensure the key is securely stored or transmitted if the program involves multiple users.

## Step 3: Validate File Existence and Accessibility

Check if the input file exists and is accessible:
If the file doesn’t exist or can’t be accessed, return an error message and exit.
If the file exists, proceed to read its content.

## Step 4: Open and Read the File

Open the file in binary mode to read all the contents (since files can contain various types of data, not just text).
Store the file’s data into a buffer (e.g., an array or string).

## Step 5: Initialize Encryption/Decryption Parameters

Convert the key into a format usable by the encryption algorithm (e.g., a byte array or binary data).
Set up the encryption method (e.g., AES, XOR):
If using a block cipher (like AES), initialize the necessary parameters such as the initialization vector (IV) and block size.
If using simpler algorithms like XOR, simply prepare the key for the XOR operation.

## Step 6: Encrypt or Decrypt File Data

6.1: Encryption Process
For encryption, follow these steps:
Read data in chunks from the file if it's large, or work with the entire content if it's small.
Apply the encryption algorithm to each chunk or the entire file:
If using a block cipher (e.g., AES), encrypt each block of data.
If using XOR encryption, XOR the data with the key (cycling through the key if necessary).
Store the encrypted data in a buffer for writing to the output file.
6.2: Decryption Process
For decryption, the process is the reverse of encryption:
Read the encrypted data from the file.
Apply the decryption algorithm:
If using a block cipher (e.g., AES), decrypt each block of data.
If using XOR encryption, XOR the data again with the key (since XOR is its own inverse).
Store the decrypted data in a buffer.

## Step 7: Write to an Output File

For encryption:

Write the encrypted data to a new file, typically with a different extension (e.g., .enc).
This file will now contain the encrypted content.
For decryption:

Write the decrypted content to a new file or overwrite the original file if necessary.
Ensure that the decrypted file is identical to the original file before encryption.

## Step 8: Handle Errors and Edge Cases

Check for errors during reading, encryption, or writing. If any error occurs (e.g., file read failure, wrong key for decryption), handle it gracefully by notifying the user and exiting.
Ensure that:
The file can be fully read and written.
The encryption/decryption process doesn’t corrupt data.
The program can handle large files efficiently (consider reading/writing in chunks for large files).

## Step 9: Provide User Feedback

After encryption, notify the user that the file has been encrypted successfully and provide the output file's location.
After decryption, notify the user that the file has been decrypted successfully.

## Step 10: Cleanup Resources

Close the input and output files to free up resources.
If the key was stored in memory or other sensitive data was handled during the encryption/decryption process, securely erase the data from memory to prevent potential leakage (especially for high-security applications).

## Step 11: Repeat or Exit

Allow the user to encrypt or decrypt another file by repeating the steps above.
Exit the program once the user decides to stop.

## Additional Considerations:

Key Strength: If using passwords as encryption keys, consider using a key derivation function (e.g., PBKDF2 or bcrypt) to generate a secure key.
Initialization Vector (IV): If using a block cipher like AES in modes like CBC, generate a random IV and store it with the ciphertext.
File Size Handling: For large files, handle data in chunks rather than reading/writing the entire file at once.
File Integrity: Optionally, add a checksum or hash to the encrypted file to verify integrity upon decryption.
