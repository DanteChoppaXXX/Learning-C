/*
Exercise 4: Detecting Memory Allocation Failure
Write a program that:

1. Tries to allocate a very large block of memory using malloc (e.g., 1000000000 * sizeof(int)).
2. Checks if the allocation was successful.
3. If successful, prints a message and frees the memory.
4. If not, prints an error message.
